# Tetris-bot-2
Now it tries to go for tetrises instead of just clearing lines

SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER than Tetris bot

Tetris bot 2 is able to achieve roughly the same stacking quality as tetris bot 1
Except it doesn't need to hold to do so
Which is way better because holding makes your life way easier but this bot can kind of manage without it
Just wait till it gets previews :)

Anyways here's some good ol reliable values that worked well for korea stacking
private static short holeCost = 41;
private static short holeCostDecayRate = 2;
private static short bumpCost = 1;
private static short lowCost = 4;
private static short wellCost = 3;
private static short lineClearReward = 8;
