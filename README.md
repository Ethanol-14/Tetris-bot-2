This branch was only created to implement the new boardstate storage logic without fear of ruining the current working main version forever.  
As such, the new boardstate storage has been successfully implemented and this branch no longer has purpose.  
As of now, its only purpose is to exist as an archive of the time when the new boardstate storage logic was successfully implemented.
